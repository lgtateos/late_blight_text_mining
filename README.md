Reconstructing Historic and Modern Potato Late Blight Outbreaks using Text Analytics

1843 Outbreak Map Data.xlsx, 1843 Outbreak Map Data.xlsx, 1843 Outbreak Map Data.xlsx spreadsheets contain passages related to outbreaks in the US between 1843 and 1845 of the potato disease later termed "late blight".   The data was automatically extracted from agricultural reports in 1843-1945 US Patent Office documents during those years using NLP and mapped with geoparsing.    The data was then manually curated.   The resulting curated datasets are posted here.
